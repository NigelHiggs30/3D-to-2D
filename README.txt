#Overview
This software is a Python application that uses the Pyglet library to render a 3D model and capture snapshots of the model at different angles as it rotates. The captured snapshots are saved as image files in a unique directory.

#Features
3D Model Loading: Load and display a 3D model from a specified file path.
Initial Rotation: Apply a random initial rotation to the model on the x-axis.
Lighting: Configure ambient lighting for better visualization.
Rotation and Snapshot: Rotate the model iteratively and capture snapshots of each rotated view, saving them to a directory.
Snapshot Directory: Automatically create a unique directory based on the current date and time to store snapshots.
